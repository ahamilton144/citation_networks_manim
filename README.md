# citation_networks_manim
Playing around with Manim Python library to create animated visualizations of citation networks

See [docs](https://docs.manim.community/en/v0.15.2/index.html) for installation instructions and examples, plus this [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-mathematical-animations-like-3blue1brown-using-python-f571fb9da3d1) post for more helpful examples.

Run ``make_scene.sh`` to create citation network animation. This will create a gif in the ``media`` directory.
